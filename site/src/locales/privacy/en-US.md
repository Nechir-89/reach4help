# Our Commitment to Your Privacy

Here at Reach4Help, the privacy of our users is very important. We want you to understand how and why Reach4Help collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our websites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online services or when you otherwise interact with us or receive communication from us.

## What data do we collect and how is it used?

Information we collect includes both information you actively provide us when using or participating in any of our services and promotions, and any information automatically sent by your devices in the course of accessing our products and services.

<br/>

For active users on our platforms, we have to collect some personal information including full names and phone numbers for verification purposes and for the safety of all users. People in need can choose to include their address for delivery requests, but unless the explicitly says that they would like us to save their address to future convenience (more delivery requests), we will never store that information. Personal information like full names and addresses are only shared with volunteers and volunteer organizations who the user explicitly accepts help from and with no other parties.

<br/>

For people who visit our website and other products, we collect non-identifiable and aggregated analytics through Google Adsense. We use this data to keep Reach4Help running, to help us improve Reach4Help, to give personalised support and to send marketing messages (but only if you explicitly agree it).

<br/>

For internal volunteers and contributors, we collect contact information as well as information on their skills and expertise for making informed decisions in what to assign them to. For those who contribute to our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/reach4help/), we collect and showcase their contributions publicly and may collect information shared by volunteers on our main communication platform [Slack](https://slack.reach4help.org/).

## How do we protect your data?

We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. We also have plans to include end-to-end encryption (similar to WhatsApp and Signal) for in-app communications.

## Where do we store your data?

The personal data we collect is processed in any data processing facilities operated by the third parties identified below.

## What third parties process your data?

The following services help us keep Reach4Help running by storing or processing your data on our behalf:

- Infrastructure: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [Airtable](https://airtable.com/),
- Analytics: [Google](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics)
- Comms: [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/)

## How long do we store your data?

We will discard and stop actively using any personal identifiable information about you within 12 months from the last time you used Reach4Help.

## Cookies

We use only necessary cookies to run and improve the service. Our third party service providers use cookies too, which they control. You can turn off cookies but this will mean for example that we can’t recognise you in in-app messaging or we can’t resolve issues so efficiently.

## Know Your Rights

You have several rights to your data! You have the right to access information we hold on you, the right to Opt-out of marketing comms, the right to port your data to another service, the right to be forgotten by Reach4Help and the right to complain about us.

<br/>

If you have any concerns about your privacy, please email us at [privacy@reach4help.org](mailto:privacy@reach4help.org).
